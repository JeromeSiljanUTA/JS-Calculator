# JS-Calculator

This is just a simple calculator that I made to learn a bit of JavaScript.

It takes one number, one operator, and another number. 

It can't do expressions like `1 + 3 + 4`, for example. It's just simple. 

C will clear input. After the result is displayed, it will be cleared when the next number is entered.
